Introduction





The objective of this study was to investigate the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of Neer classification system for shoulder fractures with a cognitive schemata.


Methods

IRB

We obtained approval from the Research Ethics Committee of São José Municipal Hospital  prior to the initiation of this project.  All study participants provided informed consent prior to enrollment in the study.

Subjects

 Participants:

R1
R2
R3 
 Images
 
Image selection:

20 images, with fracture pattern variation.
 Procedures

1a. Avaliação: present a collection of 20 images. Each participant independently classifies the images according to the AO Classification. Afterwards, the answers are collected.
2a. Avaliação: repeat the presentation of the same 20 images in 30 days.
Intervenção: nos próximos 30 dias, os residentes receberão semanalmente 20 (?) exercícios relacionados à classificação de Neer, baseados no esquema cognitivo do expert.
3a Avaliação: após os 30 dias repeat the presentation of the same 20 images 


Medidas:
inter-observer reliability
intra-observer reliability
degree of improvement in inter-observer reliability after training

Conclusions

First, provide readers with a description of future studies that should be conducted to further expand the field.
Point readers in relation to how the information presented in this manuscript might make a difference in practice.  In other words, how can the original information you have just generated be transformed into knowledge

                        
Some orthopedists have expressed concern, espe- cially in training programs, that more effort is spent trying to memorize classification systems for a num-ber of fractures, rather than truly understanding the fracture mechanics or the factors that have signifi- cant bearing on prognosis or treatment.
